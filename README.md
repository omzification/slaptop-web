# slaptop-web

‘slaptop’ is a web portfolio that I’ve been coding and designing in my free time. The site offers a unique, nostalgic design and has been made interactive using jQuery. As a static web page, the site uses [Azure Functions](https://github.com/omzification/slaptop_functions) as a serverless solution for event triggered code, as well as JSON and AJAX to streamline the publishing of new content. 

As a hobbyist photographer, the site currently showcases a few photo albums made available through Flickr API.
