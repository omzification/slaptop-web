Whilst working as an intern with Hello Group, I developed a machine learning model that could predict loan default.

One of Hello Group's product offerings is HelloPay, who provide various card payment solutions to big and small enterprises across South Africa.
Taking inspiration from Kumar Rishabh's (2024) research, I employed machine learning models linking borrowers' electronic payment histories with their loan history, allowing HelloPay to experiment with payment-history-based underwriting.

Please note that due to the sensitive nature of HelloPay's merchant data, the model linked does not display outputs.
